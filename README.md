# Sleep Diary
This is a Shiny app I built to keep a sleep diary, to identify what may help me to cope with insomnia. I have only been using it for two weeks, and I'm continuously improving it while I find out more ways that can help with insomnia and learn more about Shiny. This app has not been deployed yet, but you may clone this repo and run it locally for personal use. I still need to improve this app in many ways before I deploy it.
## To do
1. Once I accumulate enough sleep data, figure out what analysis is the most helpful for identifying what may improve insomnia and implement it in the plotting page in the app to produce a report that can be downloaded
2. Implement login screen to support multiple users
3. Right now you can only enter data for the current day. I should make it possible to enter data from any given day
4. Change to more meaningful column names when viewing data
5. Allow users to download data
6. Use text mining to analyze unstructured comments
