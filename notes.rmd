# MS Forms embedded in a RMD generated HTML website (hosted on github)

# Sign up page

## This page will allow people to read the PIS and sign the IC form
## They will enter their name, email and telephone number, and select whether they want to be emailed reminders to log data
## Periodically, the responses will be checked and the participants will be emailed an anonymous username to use when they log their data
## We will also check to see if they're already signed up (is their email address already in user_db?)
## If all good, their details will be saved in a user database (user_db.csv) along with the date and time that they signed the IC form. This file will be saved separately from any other user data and not used for research purposes. Only the PI will have access to this file.
## anonymised automatically generated participant_id will be added (liked to username) before sharing the other datasets with researchers (so researchers never see name or username) 
### OUTPUT: user_db.csv: participant ID, username, name, email, phone, would you like daily reminder emails, daily reminder texts, date and time signed up, automatically generated participant ID used to link to anonymised data in baseline.rds and daily.rds (at the user level)

# Baseline questionnaire

## participant_id: will be added after data collection (replacing username) used to link to all other datasets (user_db.rds, daily.rds)
## Trait affect was assessed with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988), which consists of 20 mood terms that are rated on a 5-point intensity scale, based on individuals’ general experiences. Scores on the NA and PA scales have shown strong internal consistency in diverse samples (alphas = 0.79–0.92), good convergent and discriminant validity with other measures of affectivity, and adequate retest reliability after two months (r = 0.59; Watson and Clark, 1999).
## PHQ-9, GAD-7
## IDAS ( Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms) is 99 items long
## Hormonal contraceptive / replacement treatment
## Age, sex, SEP, height, weight, smoking status, alcohol status
## Regular medication (free text)
## Gynaecological health and history (previous pregnancies, gynaecological disorders)
## Usual menstrual cycle length, duration of bleeding, volume, pain, regularity, physical symptoms of PMS, emotional symptoms of PMS
## All results are saved in baseline.rds 
### OUTPUT: baseline.rds (at the user level; unique identifier: participant_id)

# Daily questions

## EMA-IDAS (wellbeing and dysphoria):
## I felt optimistic / I felt that I had accomplished a lot / I felt like I had a lot to look forward to / I felt like i had a lot of interesting things to do
## I had little interest in my usual hobbies or activities / I felt depressed / I felt inadequate / I felt discouraged about things / I had trouble concentrating
## They rated how much each statement applies to them in the moment (or very recently), using a scale that ranges from 1 (“not at all”) to 5(“extremely”). 
## EMA-PANAS (positive and negative affect):
## Participants also rated their current PA (i.e.,interested, active, strong, excited) and NA (i.e., sad, upset, afraid or anxious, irritable, or angry) during EMA reports. 
## These eight terms were selected from the PANAS, with the exception of “sad”, which was added to cover a full range of NA relevant to dysphoria.
## Participants rated these items using a scale that ranges from 1 (“very slightly or not at all”) to 5 (“extremely”).

## DRSP - Endicott J, Nee J, Harrison W. Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP): reliability and validity. Arch Womens Ment Health. Springer-Verlag, Wein. 2006;9(1):43.
## Felt depressed, sad, down, or blue / Felt hopeless / Felt worthless or guilty / Felt anxious, tense, keyed up, or on edge / Had mood swings (e.g., suddenly felt sad or tearful)

## Had difficulty concentrating / Felt lethargic, tired, fatigued, or had a lack of energy / 
## Had increased appetite or overate / Had cravings for specific foods / Slept more, took naps, found it hard to get up when intended / 
## Had trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep /  Felt overwhelmed or that I could not cope / Felt out of control /  Had breast tenderness / Had breast swelling, felt bloated, or had weight gain / 
## Had headache / Had joint or muscle pain / At work, school, home, or in daily routine, at least one of the problems noted above caused reduced productivity or inefficiency /
## At least one of the problems noted above interfered with hobbies or social activities (e.g., avoided or did less) / 
## At least one of the problems noted above interfered with relationships with others / 
## Menstrual flow: H = heavy, M = medium, L = light or spotting; leave blank for no bleeding
## Record the score for each item on each day using the following scale of 1 to 6: 1=not at all, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=severe, 6=extreme.

## In past 24h: How much smoked, drank alcohol, exercised, healthiness of diet (likert scale + haven't eaten)

## Free text (anything you want to tell us - stressful event, missed medication, etc)

### OUTPUT: daily.rds (at the instance [i.e. day] level; uniquely identified using a combination of time_date + participant_id)

#### PHQ-2 + PDQ-D https://mental.jmir.org/2019/11/e12814/
#### I THINK THIS IS A BIT TOO NEGATIVE
#### How much have the following problems bothered you over the past day? 
#### Participants rated the following items: (1) lack of interest or pleasure in doing things; (2) feeling down, depressed, or hopeless;
#### and (3) trouble concentrating on things (eg, newspaper, TV). Responses were coded on a 4-point scale of severity of symptoms (1=no problem, 2=slightly, 3=somewhat, 4=greatly). 
#### This scale was modified from the 4-point scale of the PHQ-9 to reflect within-day experiences and was kept consistent for the PDQ-D item.
